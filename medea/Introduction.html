<p><strong>Seneca’s Medea with minimal notes</strong></p>
<p>Edited by <a href="https://tarelatensis.github.io/">Thomas

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This is the Latin text of Seneca’s <em>Medea</em>, with enough Latin
annotations to allow understanding by readers with only a moderate
command of Latin.</p>
<p>Simply put, the ideal outcome would be that a reader with basic
knowledge of Latin - say, someone who has gone through both volumes of
Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, maybe a bit of Caesar, and who can
easily read the Gesta Romanorum or the Vulgate - should be able to read,
understand, and hopefully enjoy the text of the play with only minimal
effort.</p>
<p>To this end, as many annotations as were thought to be helpful in
understanding the actual text were included - but only those. In
particular, only the strict minimum of mythological background that is
absolutely necessary to follow the intrigue is reported. For example,
the events of the quest for the Golden Fleece are mostly left aside;
however, the fate of Hercules and King Pelia are quickly described,
since several passages of the play assume knowledge of these events.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Latin in the notes has been deliberately kept as
simple as possible, with basic vocabulary and a syntax as close to that
of modern European languages as reasonably feasible (and sometimes
perhaps a bit beyond that). An occasional glimpse at the dictionary may
still be required here and there.</p>
<p>An important consideration has been to avoid so-called “spoilers”,
both in the notes and the main text. For some reason, many editors
routinely reveal future events when they explain a passage. This has
been avoided as much as possible here. For example, while each scene is
introduced by a quick description of the ongoing action, the actual
outcome is left unstated.</p>
<p><strong>Text</strong></p>
<p>The basic text is entirely from <a
href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Seneca_s_Tragedies/S6pM-L1KuD8C">Frank
Justus Miller’s 1927 edition</a> for the Loeb Classical Library.
However, the punctuation has been altered in various places to
facilitate comprehension.<br />
For interpreting and explaining the text, in addition to Miller’s
translation, <a
href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/L_Annaei_Senecae_Tragoediae/C4dZAAAAcAAJ">Johann
Caspar Schroeder’s 1728 edition</a> (with its many notes collated from
various authors) was also consulted, as well as <a
href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Medea_of_Seneca/Bo1fAAAAMAAJ">Hugh
MacMaster Kingery’s 1896 edition</a>. Several of Thomas Farnaby’s notes
are also reproduced from Schroeder’s collation, since they are both
highly informative and remarkably clear.</p>
<p>In one passage (“meruere cuncti”) the changes in punctuation slightly
alter the meaning and accord with Schroeder’s interpretation rather than
Miller’s.</p>
<p>Long vowels are indicated by a macron only when vowel length is
semantically or grammatically informative. Thus, <em>manūs</em> is
distinguished from <em>manus</em>, and <em>dea</em> from <em>deā</em>,
but <em>quo</em> and <em>spiritu</em> are always written without
macron.</p>
<p>In the notes, paraphrases longer than a single word are introduced by
“i.e.”, or by the term being paraphrased in italics. However, in many
cases, the words are kept identical but merely re-ordered to facilitate
comprehension (perhaps with some additional words for clarification);
these reorderings are introduced by the equal sign “=”, with any added
words enclosed in square brackets “[]”.</p>
<p><strong>Technical details</strong></p>
<p>The base working copy of this text is a <a
href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11PLcpPvVMFMB53TMorVgOgm5aIXcb4RpEwhFkV4nvkM/edit?usp=sharing">Google
Docs</a> document. This is exported as MarkDown, then converted into
HTML with Pandoc (pandoc ./Medea.md -o Medea.html --preserve-tabs). The
resulting HTML code is then processed by a Python script to apply the
formatting expected by the Tufte CSS style sheet (python process.py &gt;
Medea-processed.html), chosen both for its visual appearance and for its
excellent handling of side notes. Since this website is hosted on
GitHub, all necessary documents and scripts are included in the
repository.</p>
